presplash-color: "#8A38FF" # The presplash screen background color, of the form #RRGGBB or a color name red, green, blue etc.

orientation: portrait
# The orientations that the app will display in.
# (Available options are portrait, landscape, portrait-reverse, landscape-reverse).
# Since Android ignores android:screenOrientation when in multi-window mode (Which
# is the default on Android 12+), this option will also set the window orientation
# hints for the SDL bootstrap. If multiple orientations are given, android:screenOrientation
# will be set to unspecified.

manifest-orientation:
# The orientation that will be set for the android:screenOrientation attribute
# of the activity in the AndroidManifest.xml file. If not set, the value will
# be synthesized from the --orientation option. The full list of valid options
# is given under android:screenOrientation in the Android documentation.

permission:
# A permission that needs to be declared into the App AndroidManifest.xml. For multiple
# permissions, add multiple --permission arguments. --home-app Gives you the option to
# set your application as a home app (launcher) on your Android device.
# Note
# --permission accepts the following syntaxes:
# --permission (name=android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE;maxSdkVersion=18)
# or --permission android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.
# The first syntax is used to set additional properties to the permission
# (android:maxSdkVersion and android:usesPermissionFlags are the only ones supported for now).
# The second one can be used when there’s no need to add any additional properties.
# Warning
# The syntax --permission VIBRATE (only the permission name, without the prefix),
# is also supported for backward compatibility, but it will be removed in the future.

meta-data: # Custom key=value pairs to add in the application metadata.

presplash: # A path to the image file to use as a screen while the application is loading.
